# Charter of alXandria

{% hint style="info" %}
This charter is intended to guide the philosophy and direction of the permissionless alXandria project. As an encyclopedic effort, certain styles of writing are necessary to prevent "edit wars" over controversial topics. Ultimately, the community will decide the fate of alXandria, but moving forward with a common set of values and goals is paramount to success. Thanks for joining us!

## Articles should be fact based

* A fact is a piece of information about which there is no serious dispute. Opinions are anything that are not facts.
* Opinions should always have attributions
  * Facts can be created from opinionated statements. For example, "The president is doing a good job" is an opinion, since it is contested by many. If it is to included in an encyclopedia it should have an attribution, e.g. "Person X said 'The president is doing a good job' \[citation]." This is a fact because it is verifiable that Person X said that, and is therefore not seriously disputed.
* Articles should be written in the third-person.
* Articles should be written in a tone that doesn't signify certainity of a position.
  * Article should not state: "Abortion is morally acceptable." This is an opinion written in a tone signifying certainty.
  * To the utmost extent, authors should characterize disputes rather than engage in disputes. Put another way, controversial views should be presented without being asserted.
  * Some controversial subjects do not share equal support. This should be characterized in the most factually accurate way.
    * If an article discussed COVID-19 vaccination debates, one could say "X% of doctors believe Y while W% of doctors believe Z \[citation]." Even if the numbers aren't even, it doesn't violate neutrality since it is a fact.
    * A second way to approach the controversial subject would be to reduce the article's scope and only cover one side. For example, instead of an article entitled "COVID-19 Vaccination Debate," one could instead do "Pro-COVID-19 Vaccination Arguments." This would allow one to discuss only the facts of one-side of the issue.

## alXandria believes in permissionless access to knowledge

* This means _all topics_ and _all viewpoints_ are tolerated.
* Why tolerate ethically repugnant viewpoints?
  1. alXandria is an encyclopedia, so no ethical viewpoints should be argued in the first-place.
  2. Biased-articles dissuade intellectual crossover
     * When one reads an article with clear bias, it calls into question the validity of all facts cited.
     * Open-minded inquirers have the best chance of altering harmful views through the honest assessment of facts.
     * We are all endowed with intellectual freedom, and people should be allowed to sovereignly come to their independent conclusions.
     * If ethically regugnant viewpoints are characterized, and not asserted, it factually repesents reality. Reality cannot be banned in fact-oriented endeavors.
* Neutrality of information combined with freedom is the best antidote to dogmatic control of media. This is the long game!
