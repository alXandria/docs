# What is alXandria?

## Problems With Web2 Encyclopedias

_**Censorship**_

Despite Wikipedia’s noble origins, [according to it’s co-founder Larry Sanger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0P4Cf0UCwU), the platform has become a gatekeeper for establishment views: “\[now] it’s really hard to participate, on a lot of articles if you go in and you make any edit at all, you will be sternly warned if not just kicked out, and it doesn’t matter if its a completely positive edit. This sometimes even happens on articles that are unimportant.”

_**Socialized Work, Privatized Gains**_

In 2021, the Wikipedia Foundation earned 154 million dollars in revenue, yet contributors receive no compensation for their work. When you research, post, and update articles, you add value to Wikipedia without reaping a portion of the rewards.&#x20;

_**Information Manipulation**_

On page 228 of Larry Sanger's book, _Essays on Free Knowledge_, he asserts: “I believe Wikipedia is thoroughly corrupt—the information in it is carefully massaged through behind-the-scenes control and payoffs.”

_**Slow**_

As of December 21, 2022, [Wikipedia’s Article Wizard states](https://web.archive.org/web/20221221165252/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article\_wizard/CreateDraft): “Reviews can take a long time, so please be patient and rest assured that your draft will be reviewed in due course. This may take 4 months or more, since drafts are reviewed in no specific order.”&#x20;

## Solutions With alXandria

_**No Censorship**_

By utilizing a public ledger as the database, all contributors have access to updating the alXandria platform. Unlike the Wikipedia Foundation, the alXandria team does not have special privileges to change the user-generated content on the alXandria smart-contract.

_**Socialized Work, Socialized Gains**_

Once a suitable user base has adopted alXandria, the team will turn on fees for article creation, dually enabling fee-shares for authors. This means authors will receive a portion of the fees for editing their articles or for high page visitation.

_**Information Integrity**_

alXandria will be as good as the community decides to make it. There is no one for the government to bribe to change alXandria's content, as the site will display what is posted.

_**Speed**_

Considering the block time on Juno is \~6 seconds, on average, **publishing an article on alXandria will be 1.7 million times faster than on Wikipedia**.
