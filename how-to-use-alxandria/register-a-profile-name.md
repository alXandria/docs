  anyone else!

# Register a Profile Name

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** It costs 1 $JUNO to register a profile name. Profile names are _<mark style="color:blue;">immutable</mark>_. This means that once you register your profile name to a wallet address, you cannot change it. Profile names are also _<mark style="color:blue;">optional</mark>_. If you choose not to register a profile name, your wallet address will be stored as the author. Profile names are not stored when editing articles.
{% endhint %}

1. &#x20;**Choose a profile name**_**.**_ Your profile name can be any string, so long as it doesn't take up too much storage to bloat the block with other information. _<mark style="color:blue;">Profile names are formatted to remove spaces and lowercase the input.</mark>_ This means that entering "V i T a L i K" is the same as trying to register "vitalik". If you try to register a name that already exists, or if you try to register a second name, the transaction will fail.
